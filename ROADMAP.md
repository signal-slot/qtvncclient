# QtVnc Improvement Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the planned improvements for the QtVnc project. It's organized by priority areas and intended to guide development efforts. Each section contains specific tasks that will enhance the functionality, performance, usability, and maintainability of the library.

## Current Status (February 2025)

The QtVnc library currently provides:

- Raw encoding for framebuffer updates
- Basic keyboard and mouse input handling
- Simple integration with Qt applications
